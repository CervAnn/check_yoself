# Check Yo'Self

Ann Cerveny - 1903 FEE

This project is an attempt to replicate a dynamic composition titled "Check Yo'Self", a checklist application. Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, a user is able to have an interactive experience where they can create tasks and append them into lists. After the list of tasks is instantiated in a card, a user is able to check items off as they are completed, and may delete the card upon completing all tasks. This project served as an individual final project for the Turing School of Software and Design for Mod 1 of the Front End Engineering program.
